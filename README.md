### Overview of Election Audit
The goal of the election audit was to find the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. This information was meant to be found, reformatted, and displayed clearly.

### Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used to calculate the election results of the CSV file. This script can efficiently accommodate large sums of data, and format this data in a transparent comprehensible manner. This script is written to sort locations and to count the number of times those locations are written. That information is then transcribed to show the votes per location and percentage of votes each location received. The script uses a very similar process to determine the candidate votes, percentages, and winners.  Some modifications that could potentially be needed include modifying the rows where the candidate and county data is pulled from and changing the path file to accommodate the location of the new data.
